# Wagento SMS Notifications powered by LINK Mobility

Wagento SMS Notifications integrates Magento 2 with the LINK Mobility
mobile messaging service to send transactional text notifications. Customers can
be notified when their order is successfully placed as well as when it is
invoiced, shipped, canceled, refunded, held, or released.

Detailed instructions for installation, configuration and usage can be found in
the [User Guide].

## Requirements

* PHP 7.1.3+ or 7.2.0+
* Magento Open Source/Commerce 2.2.27+ or 2.3.0+
* A [LINK Mobility] account

## Installation

### Composer (recommended)

We highly recommend purchasing the extension from the [Magento Marketplace],
where you can receive the latest version for free. Once purchased, you can use
the following command to install it from a terminal or command prompt:

    cd /path/to/your/site && composer require wagento/module-linkmobility-sms-notifications

**Note:** The Marketplace version is compatible with both Magento 2.3 and 2.2.
For 2.2, PHP 7.1 is required, while 7.2 is recommended for 2.3.

### Manual

This extension can be downloaded from [GitHub] and installed into the
`app/code` directory of your Magento installation with these commands:

    cd /path/to/your/site/app/code
    mkdir Wagento
    cd Wagento
    git clone git@github.com:wagento/linkmobility-sms-notifications.git LinkMobilitySMSNotifications

For Magento 2.2, you will need to append this line to `registration.php`:

    require 'compat.inc';

**Warning**: `compat.inc` contains aliases for interfaces and classes that exist
in 2.3 but are not available in 2.2. If any other installed extensions require
these interfaces and/or classes and provide their own work-arounds, you may
experience compatibility issues and/or degraded site performance. If this
occurs, please [open a support ticket][Support] and let us know the vendor and
extension name so that we can work with them on a solution.

### Post-Install

After installing the extension for the first time, please run this command to
enable it:
